# NPM Scripts Best Practices

## Command Chaining in package.json Scripts

When chaining multiple commands in npm scripts, use semicolons (`;`) instead of double ampersands (`&&`).

### Why?
- `&&` can be unreliable on Windows systems
- `;` works consistently across all platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux)
- Vercel and other CI/CD platforms handle `;` more reliably

### Examples

**❌ Don't do this:**
```json
"build": "prisma migrate deploy && prisma generate && next build"
```

**✅ Do this instead:**
```json
"build": "prisma migrate deploy; prisma generate; next build"
```

### Key Difference
- `&&` - Runs next command only if previous succeeds (short-circuit)
- `;` - Runs all commands sequentially regardless of exit codes

For build scripts where all commands should run, `;` is the safer choice and works more reliably across environments.
