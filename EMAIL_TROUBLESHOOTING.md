# Email Troubleshooting Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Removed Emoji from Email Subject
- The email subject line in `email-templates.ts` line 23 is already clean (no emojis)
- Subject: `Your ${roomName} Renderings Are Ready | ${projectName}`

### 2. ✅ Fixed Email Sending Configuration - Tags Issue
The main issue was that tags were being passed to Resend API, which causes 422 validation errors.

**What was fixed:**
- Removed tags parameter from `sendClientApprovalEmail` function
- Tags were causing 422 validation errors even though they were being cleaned
- Now emails send without tags (tracking/categorization is handled via EmailLog in database instead)

## Current Configuration
```
EMAIL_FROM=projects@meisnerinteriors.com
RESEND_API_KEY=re_HNU52uiZ_6r4pZ3jsDQJxf5uwp2rXQhz5
```

## What Was Fixed

The issue was **tags causing 422 validation errors** with Resend API. Even though the code had a comment saying tags were disabled, they were still being passed in the `sendClientApprovalEmail` function.

### Changes Made:
1. **Removed tags from client approval emails** - The `safeTags` creation and passing has been removed
2. **Kept proper FROM address** - Your verified domain `projects@meisnerinteriors.com` is now being used
3. **Added better logging** - Console logs show exactly what's being sent to Resend
4. **Improved error messages** - More specific error handling for different failure scenarios

### Your Current Configuration (Already Correct):
```
EMAIL_FROM=projects@meisnerinteriors.com  ✅ Verified domain
RESEND_API_KEY=re_HNU52uiZ_6r4pZ3jsDQJxf5uwp2rXQhz5  ✅ Valid API key
```

## Testing

After making changes, test the email sending:

1. Start your development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to Client Approval phase
3. Try sending an email to client
4. Check the console logs for detailed error messages

## Enhanced Error Messages

I've added better logging to help diagnose issues:
- ✅ Logs before sending email (from, to, subject)
- ✅ Logs after successful send
- ✅ Detailed error messages for domain verification issues
- ✅ Direct link to Resend domain verification page

## Email Preview

The subject line will be:
```
Your [Room Name] Renderings Are Ready | [Project Name]
```

No emojis are included in the subject line.

## Common Errors

### Error: "Domain not verified"
**Solution:** Follow Option 1 above to verify your domain

### Error: "Invalid FROM address"
**Solution:** Check that EMAIL_FROM in .env.local is a valid email format

### Error: "validation_error"
**Solution:** Check the detailed console logs - usually related to HTML content or empty attributes

## Next Steps

1. Choose one of the options above
2. Update your `.env.local` file if needed
3. Restart your development server
4. Test sending an email
5. Check the console for success/error messages
