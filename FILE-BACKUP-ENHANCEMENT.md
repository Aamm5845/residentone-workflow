# ðŸ”§ File Backup Enhancement (Optional)

If you want to backup actual image/file contents (not just metadata), here are options:

## Option 1: Enhanced API (Advanced)
Create `/api/admin/backup-with-files` that:
- Downloads files from Dropbox
- Includes base64-encoded images in backup
- Creates much larger backup files (10-100MB+)

## Option 2: Separate File Backup Script
Create a script that:
- Lists all asset URLs from database
- Downloads files from Dropbox API
- Creates a ZIP file with all images

## Option 3: Dropbox Backup Integration
- Use Dropbox API to create snapshots
- Link database backups with Dropbox snapshots
- Restore both together

## Current Recommendation:
Your current setup is already excellent because:
- Database backup protects all data/structure
- Dropbox protects all files automatically
- No duplication of large files
- Restore process is fast and reliable

Most businesses use this exact approach: database backups + cloud file storage.
