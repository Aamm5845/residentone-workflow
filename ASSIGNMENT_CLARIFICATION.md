# Assignment System Clarification

## âœ… Current System (Working as Intended)

**Assignment = Responsibility, NOT Access Control**

### How It Works:
1. **Any team member** can work on any stage that's IN_PROGRESS
2. **Assignment** just means:
   - The assigned person gets notifications
   - Stage shows up in their task list
   - They are "responsible" for completion
3. **Only OWNER/ADMIN** can manage assignments (change who is responsible)

### Access Rights:
- âœ… **Everyone** can click "Open Workspace" on IN_PROGRESS stages
- âœ… **Everyone** can work on any stage content
- âœ… **Everyone** can see all stages
- ðŸ”’ **Only OWNER/ADMIN** can change assignments

## ðŸ’¡ UI Improvements to Consider

If team members are confused, consider adding:

### 1. Tooltip/Help Text
Add a tooltip to assignment info explaining:
> "Assignment indicates responsibility. All team members can contribute to any stage."

### 2. Clarify Button Text
Instead of just "Open Workspace", could show:
> "Open Workspace (Available to All Team Members)"

### 3. Assignment Info Enhancement  
Show both:
- **Responsible:** [Assigned Person]
- **Access:** Available to all team members

### 4. Help/Info Icon
Add a small info icon near assignments that explains the system.

## ðŸŽ¯ The System is Already Perfect

Your assignment system works exactly as most collaborative teams want:
- **Clear responsibility** (assigned person)  
- **Team collaboration** (everyone can help)
- **Proper notifications** (assigned person gets notified)
- **Management control** (only admins assign)

No changes needed to functionality - just potentially clarify the UI messaging if team members are confused.
