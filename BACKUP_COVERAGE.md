## What About Images?

- If images are hosted on Dropbox/cloud, the URLs will still work
- If images are on local server, you'll need to backup files separately

### Complete Backup:
- ✅ **All images downloaded and embedded** (up to 50MB each)
- ✅ Stored as base64 in the backup file
- ✅ Can be restored to any storage provider

---

## Is My Database Safe?

### During Backup:
- ✅ **100% Safe** - Backup is READ-ONLY
- ✅ Database is NOT modified
- ✅ No deletion happens
- ✅ Just reads data and creates JSON file

### During Restore:
- ⚠️ **DESTRUCTIVE** - Replaces ALL data
- ⚠️ Requires confirmation dialog
- ⚠️ Only OWNER can restore
- ✅ Always create a backup BEFORE restoring
