üìã Migration Steps for Team Notification System:

1. Generate the migration:
   npx prisma migrate dev --name add-notification-send-table

2. Generate the Prisma client:
   npx prisma generate

3. Restart your development server

4. Test the feature:
   - Complete a phase (like Design Concept)
   - The notification modal should appear
   - Select Vitor (or any next-phase assignee) 
   - Send the notification
   - Check that the email is sent via Resend

‚öôÔ∏è  Environment Variables Required:
   - RESEND_API_KEY (already configured for client emails)
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL (for project links in emails)

üéØ How It Works:
   - When you complete a phase, a modal asks if you want to notify the next assignees
   - For Design Concept ‚Üí notifies Vitor (if assigned to 3D Rendering)
   - For Client Approval ‚Üí notifies both DRAWINGS and FFE assignees
   - Prevents duplicate notifications
   - Tracks all sent notifications in the database

‚úÖ All Current Functionality Preserved:
   - Phase completion works exactly as before
   - All existing features remain intact
   - New notification modal is optional (can skip)
