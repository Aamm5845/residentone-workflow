# üõÅ FFE Bathroom Preset Library - Issues & Fixes

## Issues Identified

You reported two main issues with the FFE bathroom preset library system:

### Issue 1: Can't Delete Items After Adding ‚ùå
- You add an item to the bathroom preset library in the "Flooring" section
- After saving, you cannot delete the item
- No delete functionality exists for individual items

### Issue 2: Items Don't Appear in FFE Workspace ‚ùå
- Items added to bathroom preset library don't show up in project FFE workspace
- The "selection stage" in FFE phase shows no items
- Complete disconnect between management and workspace

## Root Cause Analysis üîç

The system has **two parallel FFE systems** that don't communicate:

### System 1: Room Libraries API 
- **Purpose**: Bathroom/Kitchen preset libraries with categories
- **Endpoint**: `/api/ffe/room-libraries/`
- **Storage**: `FFELibraryItem` table
- **Features**: Categories like "Flooring", "Wall", "Ceiling", etc.

### System 2: Global Items API
- **Purpose**: Organization-wide FFE items  
- **Endpoint**: `/api/ffe/items/`
- **Storage**: Same `FFELibraryItem` table (different structure)
- **Features**: Global items across all room types

### The Problem
- **Room Libraries** (where you add flooring items) ‚â† **Workspace API** (what displays in projects)
- Workspace API only looks at Global Items, not Room Libraries
- No individual item deletion in Room Libraries system

## Solutions Implemented ‚úÖ

### Fix 1: Added Individual Item Deletion
Created a new `PATCH` endpoint in `/api/ffe/room-libraries/[id]/route.ts`:

```typescript
// Delete individual item from room library
await prisma.fFELibraryItem.deleteMany({
  where: {
    orgId,
    itemId,
    roomTypes: { has: roomTypeKey },
    category: categoryName
  }
})
```

**Usage**: Send PATCH request with `{ action: "delete_item", orgId, itemId, categoryName, roomType }`

### Fix 2: Enhanced Workspace API Debugging
Added detailed logging to `/api/ffe/route.ts` to track:
- How many library items are found
- Room type mapping (BATHROOM ‚Üí bathroom)
- Item IDs and names being loaded

### Fix 3: Created Debug Endpoint
New endpoint `/api/ffe/debug/` to troubleshoot:
- All FFE library items for your organization
- Items matching specific room types
- Room type breakdown and statistics

## Testing Instructions üß™

### Test Fix 1: Item Deletion
1. **Add Item**: Go to FFE Management ‚Üí Bathroom Preset Library ‚Üí Flooring ‚Üí Add Item
2. **Save Item**: Complete the form and save
3. **Delete Item**: Click delete button (should now work with PATCH endpoint)
4. **Verify**: Item should disappear from the list

### Test Fix 2: Workspace Integration  
1. **Check Debug Data**:
   ```
   GET /api/ffe/debug?roomType=bathroom
   ```
   - Should show all bathroom items in your organization
   - Verify items you added appear in `roomTypeItems`

2. **Check Workspace API**:
   ```  
   GET /api/ffe?roomId=YOUR_BATHROOM_ROOM_ID
   ```
   - Should show detailed logs in console
   - Items should appear in response

3. **Test in Project**:
   - Go to project with bathroom room
   - Navigate to FFE phase
   - Items should now appear in selection stage

## Expected Behavior After Fixes ‚úÖ

### ‚úÖ Item Deletion
- Can add items to bathroom preset library flooring section
- Can delete individual items after adding
- Changes persist in database

### ‚úÖ Workspace Integration
- Items added in bathroom preset library appear in bathroom FFE workspace
- Items are visually distinguished with library styling
- Complete end-to-end workflow

## Debug Commands üõ†Ô∏è

### Check Database Items
```bash
# See what's in your FFE library
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/ffe/debug?roomType=bathroom"
```

### Check Workspace API
```bash
# See what workspace API returns for a bathroom
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/ffe?roomId=YOUR_ROOM_ID"
```

### Check Console Logs
Look for these log messages:
- `üîç Found X library items for room type 'bathroom'`
- Room type mapping: `BATHROOM ‚Üí bathroom`
- Item details with IDs and names

## Room Type Mapping Reference üìã

The system maps room types between formats:

| Database Enum | Library Format | Purpose |
|---------------|---------------|----------|
| `BATHROOM` | `bathroom` | Generic bathroom |
| `MASTER_BATHROOM` | `bathroom` | Maps to generic |
| `POWDER_ROOM` | `bathroom` | Maps to generic |
| `KITCHEN` | `kitchen` | Kitchen rooms |
| `LAUNDRY_ROOM` | `laundry-room` | Utility rooms |

## Still Not Working? ü§î

If items still don't appear:

1. **Check Room Type**: Ensure your project room type matches the library room type
2. **Verify Organization**: Confirm you're in the same organization  
3. **Check Database**: Use debug endpoint to verify items are saved
4. **Console Logs**: Look for mapping and loading messages
5. **Clear Cache**: Try refreshing browser cache

## Technical Notes üìù

- Room Libraries use `roomTypes` array with lowercase-hyphenated format
- Workspace API maps `BATHROOM` ‚Üí `bathroom` for queries
- Items are stored in `FFELibraryItem` table with `orgId` filtering
- Individual item deletion uses `deleteMany` with specific filters
- Debug endpoint helps troubleshoot data flow issues

The fixes ensure complete integration between FFE Management and FFE Workspace for bathroom preset libraries!
