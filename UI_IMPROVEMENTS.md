# StudioFlow by Meisner Interiors UI Improvements - Asana-Inspired Design

## üé® **NEW USER-FRIENDLY INTERFACE**

### **What We Changed:**
The original interface was too technical and hard to understand. We've completely redesigned it with an **Asana-inspired layout** that's much more intuitive for interior designers.
