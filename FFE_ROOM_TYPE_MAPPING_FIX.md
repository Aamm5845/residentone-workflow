# ✅ FFE Room Type Mapping Fix

## Issue Fixed
Items added in **FFE Management** were not appearing in the **FFE Workspace** because of inconsistent room type formats between the management system and workspace API.

## Root Cause
1. **FFE Management** saves items with room types in uppercase enum format: `'KITCHEN'`, `'LAUNDRY_ROOM'`, `'MASTER_BATHROOM'`
2. **FFE Workspace API** expects room types in lowercase-hyphenated format: `'kitchen'`, `'laundry-room'`, `'bathroom'`
3. The mismatch meant that library items were never matched to workspace rooms.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Room Type Mapping Utility
```typescript
function mapRoomTypeToWorkspaceFormat(roomType: string): string {
  const roomTypeMapping = {
    'KITCHEN': 'kitchen',
    'LAUNDRY_ROOM': 'laundry-room',
    'BATHROOM': 'bathroom',
    'MASTER_BATHROOM': 'bathroom',
    'FAMILY_BATHROOM': 'bathroom',
    // ... complete mapping
  }
  return roomTypeMapping[roomType] || roomType.toLowerCase().replace('_', '-')
}
```

### 2. Applied Mapping in Key Locations
- ✅ `src/app/api/ffe/items/route.ts` - When creating FFE items via management UI
- ✅ `src/lib/ffe/library-manager.ts` - When adding custom items to library
- ✅ `src/lib/ffe/library-manager.ts` - When auto-adding project items to library

### 3. Room Type Mappings
| Management Format | Workspace Format | Notes |
|------------------|-----------------|-------|
| `KITCHEN` | `kitchen` | Direct mapping |
| `LAUNDRY_ROOM` | `laundry-room` | Underscore to hyphen |
| `BATHROOM` | `bathroom` | Generic bathroom |
| `MASTER_BATHROOM` | `bathroom` | Maps to generic |
| `FAMILY_BATHROOM` | `bathroom` | Maps to generic |
| `POWDER_ROOM` | `bathroom` | Maps to generic |
| `LIVING_ROOM` | `living-room` | Underscore to hyphen |
| `BEDROOM` | `bedroom` | Direct mapping |
| `MASTER_BEDROOM` | `bedroom` | Maps to generic |
| `GUEST_BEDROOM` | `bedroom` | Maps to generic |
| `DINING_ROOM` | `dining-room` | Underscore to hyphen |
| `OFFICE` | `office` | Direct mapping |
| `STUDY_ROOM` | `office` | Maps to office |
| `FOYER` | `foyer` | Direct mapping |
| `PLAYROOM` | `playroom` | Direct mapping |

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Test Kitchen Items
1. Go to **Preferences → FFE Management**
2. Click **"Add Global Item"**
3. Enter:
   - **Name**: "Test Kitchen Item"
   - **Category**: "Furniture" 
   - **Room Types**: Select "Kitchen" (`KITCHEN`)
   - **Level**: "Base Level"
   - **Scope**: "Room Specific"
4. Save the item

### 2. Verify in Workspace
1. Go to a **Project** with a **Kitchen** room
2. Navigate to **FFE Phase** for that room
3. **Expected**: The "Test Kitchen Item" should now appear with:
   - Purple border (library item styling)
   - "Library" badge
   - Default "Not Started" status

### 3. Test Other Room Types
Repeat for:
- **LAUNDRY_ROOM** items → appear in Laundry Room workspaces
- **BATHROOM** items → appear in all bathroom types
- **BEDROOM** items → appear in all bedroom types
- **FOYER** items → appear in Foyer workspaces
- **PLAYROOM** items → appear in Playroom workspaces

## Expected Results After Fix

✅ **FFE Management → Database**
- Items saved with mapped room types (`kitchen`, `laundry-room`, etc.)

✅ **Database → Workspace API**  
- Library query: `roomTypes: { has: 'kitchen' }` matches saved items

✅ **Workspace API → UI Display**
- Items appear in correct room types with visual distinction

✅ **End-to-End Flow**
- Add item for "Kitchen" in management → appears in Kitchen room FFE workspace
- Add item for "Laundry Room" in management → appears in Laundry Room FFE workspace
- Consistent behavior across all supported room types

## Files Modified

1. `src/app/api/ffe/items/route.ts` - Added room type mapping to POST method
2. `src/lib/ffe/library-manager.ts` - Added mapping utility functions and applied to all item creation methods

## Notes

- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing items in database may still have old format room types. The mapping function handles both formats.
- **Future Room Types**: New room types can be added to the mapping object.
- **Fallback Logic**: If a room type isn't in the mapping, it defaults to lowercase with underscores replaced by hyphens.

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check database for room type formats
# Should show mapped formats like 'kitchen', 'laundry-room'
SELECT DISTINCT jsonb_array_elements_text(roomTypes) as room_type 
FROM "FFELibraryItem" 
ORDER BY room_type;
```

The fix ensures complete consistency between the FFE Management system and the FFE Workspace, resolving the connection issue where items weren't appearing in their designated room phases.
