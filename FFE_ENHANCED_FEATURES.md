# 🎯 Enhanced FFE System Features

## Overview

I've significantly improved your FFE (Furniture, Fixtures, Equipment) system with the features you requested. Here's what's new:

## ✨ New Features

### 1. **Enhanced Settings Button**
Located in the FFE workspace header, the Settings button now provides:

- **Import Template**: Choose from existing templates to add sections and items
- **Add Section**: Create new sections with multiple items at once
- **Add Item**: Add individual items to existing sections
- **Quantity Support**: Specify quantities (e.g., 3 tiles creates "Tiles #1", "Tiles #2", "Tiles #3")
- **Reset Instance**: Clear all FFE data and start over

### 2. **Improved Item States**
Each FFE item now supports these states:

- **🤔 Undecided**: Decision still pending
- **⏳ Pending**: Item is in progress  
- **🔵 Selected**: Item has been chosen
- **💜 Confirmed**: Selection is confirmed
- **✅ Completed**: Item is fully complete
- **❌ Not Needed**: Item is not required

### 3. **Enhanced Notes System**
- **Per-item Notes**: Each item has its own notes dialog
- **Visual Indicators**: Items with notes are highlighted
- **Persistent Storage**: Notes are saved automatically
- **Team Visibility**: Notes are visible to all team members

### 4. **Quantity Management**
- **Multiple Items**: Create multiple trackable items from one (e.g., 3 tiles)
- **Individual Tracking**: Each quantity item can have its own state and notes
- **Automatic Naming**: Items are automatically numbered (#1, #2, #3)

### 5. **Better Data Persistence**
- **Database Storage**: All states and notes are properly saved
- **Session Persistence**: Data persists across browser sessions
- **Progress Tracking**: Automatic calculation of completion percentages
