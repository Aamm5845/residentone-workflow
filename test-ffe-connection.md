# FFE Management-Workspace Connection Test

## What was fixed:

1. **The Problem**: FFE Management system stored items in a format incompatible with the FFE Workspace
   - Management used `itemType: 'ITEM'` marker and stored room types in `category` field
   - Workspace looked for items in `roomTypes` array without the `itemType` filter
   - Result: Management items never appeared in workspace

2. **The Solution**: Modified management system to store items in workspace-compatible format
   - Items now stored with proper `category` (actual category) and `roomTypes` array (mapped room types)
   - Added `managementItem: true` flag in `subItems` for identification
   - Updated GET/PUT/DELETE endpoints to handle both old and new formats
   - Workspace now includes management items when querying for library items

## Test Steps:

1. **Clear existing data** (if needed):
   - Go to FFE Management → Room Types → "Clear All Room Types"
   
2. **Create a room type**:
   - Add "bathroom" room type
   - Link it to specific bathroom types (family-bathroom, master-bathroom, etc.)

3. **Create categories**:
   - Add "Flooring" category for bathroom
   - Add "Plumbing" category for bathroom  

4. **Create items**:
   - Add "Tile Flooring" item in Flooring category for bathroom
   - Add "Vanity" item in Plumbing category for bathroom

5. **Test in workspace**:
   - Go to any family bathroom room workspace
   - Should now see:
     - Categories: Flooring, Plumbing
     - Items: Tile Flooring (under Flooring), Vanity (under Plumbing)
     - Plus any existing room-specific items

## Expected Result:
- Management items should now appear in ALL room workspaces
- Categories should be properly displayed with items grouped under them
- Items should be available for selection/configuration in room workspaces

## Files Modified:
- `src/app/api/ffe/management/items/route.ts` - Fixed to store in workspace-compatible format
- `src/app/api/ffe/route.ts` - Updated to include active management items
