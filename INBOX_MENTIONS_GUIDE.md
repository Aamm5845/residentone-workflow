# Inbox & @Mentions Guide

## Overview

The Inbox feature in the navigation shows notifications specifically for @mentions. When someone mentions you in a comment, message, or chat, you'll receive a notification that appears in your Inbox.

## Features Added

### 1. Inbox in Left Sidebar Navigation
- Located in the left sidebar navigation menu, positioned between Home and My Projects
- Shows an inbox icon with a red notification badge when there are unread @mention notifications
- Clicking navigates to a dedicated Inbox page showing all your mention notifications

### 2. Individual Mention Notifications
- Each @mention creates a separate notification item that appears in your Inbox
- Shows the person who mentioned you and a preview of their message
- Each notification remains unread until you click on it individually
- Notifications are organized into "Unread" and "Read" sections
- Bulk actions available: "Mark Selected Read" and "Mark All Read"

## How @Mentions Work

### For Users (Mentioning Someone)
1. **In any comment field** that supports mentions, type `@` followed by a person's name
2. **Auto-suggestions** will appear showing team members matching your search
3. **Use arrow keys** to navigate suggestions and press Enter/Tab to select
4. **Submit your comment** - mentioned users will automatically receive notifications

### For Users (Being Mentioned)
1. **Notification appears** in your Inbox (inbox icon in top navigation)
2. **Red badge** shows the count of unread mentions
3. **Click the inbox** to see all your mentions
4. **Click a specific mention** to navigate to the relevant page
5. **Mark as read** by clicking the mention or use "Mark all read"

## Where Mentions Work

@mentions are supported in:
- ‚úÖ **Design Comments** (Design workspace comments)
- ‚úÖ **Stage Comments** (Individual stage comments)
- ‚úÖ **Chat Messages** (Phase chat conversations)
- ‚úÖ **Project Comments** (Various project-related discussions)

## Technical Details

### Mention Processing
- Uses regex pattern: `/@([a-zA-Z]+(?:\\s+[a-zA-Z]+)*)/g`
- Supports names with spaces (e.g., "John Doe")
- Case-insensitive matching
- Prevents self-mentions (you can't notify yourself)

### Notification Creation
- Creates notifications with type "MENTION"
- Includes context about where the mention occurred
- Links to the relevant page/stage for easy navigation
- Shows preview of the message content

### User Lookup
- Searches active team members by name
- Limited to organization members only
- Filters out deleted/inactive users
- Currently restricted to: aaron@meisnerinteriors.com, shaya@meisnerinteriors.com, sami@meisnerinteriors.com, euvi.3d@gmail.com

## Usage Examples

### In a Design Comment
```
Hey @Aaron, can you review the color palette for the living room? 
I think the @Shaya suggestion about the accent wall might work better.
```

### In Phase Chat
```
@Team, the client approved the initial concept. 
@Sami, can you start working on the 3D renders?
```

### In Stage Comments
```
@Aaron, I've completed the furniture layout. 
Please review when you have a moment.
```

## Best Practices
